    Working with the Docs To Go Team and participating in their two-three work periods (called sprints) has been a
unique and rewarding learning experience. Previously, about a year ago, the methodology for the development of software
turned completely on its head. Instead of using older, outdated techniques such as Waterfall, engineers and managers
alike resorted to a newer, more contemporary viewpoint. It was in this thinking that Agile and Scrum emerged, ready to
be utilized. The main difference between the new and the old is largely related to time management. Waterfall was a
fairly straightforward methodology in which one process came after another (requirements, design, implementation, etc.).
However, Agile/Scrum differs completely in that the entire process is broken into sprints, which consist solely of
development and testing. The benefits are simple: Less time and resources are required as well as a more flexible
schedule, allowing for the developers to have a better understanding of their objectives (which change frequently).
    In addition, working in a group environment has been an eye-opening experience for me. Being a high school student,
working on your own has always been the norm, especially when it came to labs and projects in classes such as AP
Computer Science A. Experiencing and taking a part of a multi-national group has been very insightful for me to obtain a
deeper understanding of the outside working world. Working under strict deadlines and collaborating with other people
enchanced my communication skills and allowed me to extend my own boundaries and venture outside my comfort zone.
