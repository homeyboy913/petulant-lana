    My name is Samuel Kai Hsieh; I am 17 year old Chinese-American born in Walnut Creek, California.
I attended Seven Hills School from Preschool-8th grade, also located in Walnut Creek, California.
Throughout my middle school career I have participated on a math team called Math Counts, and
competed in vaious school tournaments. In the summers of my 6th and 7th grade, I went to the prestigious
Center For Talented Youth's (CTY) math camp, hosted by Johns Hopkins University at Stanford. Each of
the two years covered a wide range of topics including Inductive and Deductive reasoning, and Data and
Chance. Currently, I am a senior at Monte Vista High School in Danville, California. I am involved in a
various clubs including: Android club, French Honors Society, and Families Without Borders.
In my free time I enjoy playing a range of sports including bowling, pool, badminton, tennis, and golf.
The latter in which I have played for 10 years, competing in state and national tournaments for more than
5 years, and reaching Varsity level by freshman year. While not golfing or playing
other sports, I enjoy cooking, investing, building computers, and above all, cars and driving.
