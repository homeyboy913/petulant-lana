    My name is Samuel Kai Hsieh; I am 17 year old Chinese-American born in Walnut Creek, California.
I have attended Seven Hills School from Preschool-8th grade, also in Walnut Creek, California.
Throughout my middle school career I have participated in a math competition called Math Counts, and
competed in tournaments. During the summers of my 6th and 7th grade, I have participated in the
Center For Talented Youth's (CTY) math camp hosted by Johns Hopkins University, at Stanford. Each year
covered a wide range of topics including Inductive and Deductive reasoning, and Data and Chance.
    Currently, I am a senior at Monte Vista High School in Danville, California. In my free time I enjoy playing
a range of sports including bowling, pool, badminton, tennis, and golf. The latter in which I have played for
10 years, competing in state and national tournaments for some 5 years, and reaching Varsity level by freshman year.
While not golfing or playing other sports, I enjoy cooking, investing (stocks and commodities), building computers,
and above all, cars and driving.
