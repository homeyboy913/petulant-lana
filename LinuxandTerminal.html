    <b>Introduction:</b>
    <br>
    To me, linux has always seemed to be an incredibly daunting and unforgiving operating system, which would be difficult to learn,
and impossible to master. This expectation comes from the relentless nature of its case sensitive command line. If any command is
mistyped by even a single character, then nothing will register, rendering the whole command useless. Although, I have acquired
some previous experience with linux (setting up a NFS file server), learning the syntax of basic commands, as well as installing
applications or packages inside the terminal window. Even though Windows is far more popular of an operating system, my perilous
journey of learning linux has led me to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each of the operating systems, and realize how
specialized they are.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Role:</b>
    <br>
    Near the beginning of my internship at BlackBerry, my mentor guided me through the plethora of commands
that ubuntu (a distribution of linux) is made up of. These commands are needed to communicate with the computer, and are
crucial skills which must be readily accessible in every programmer's toolbelt. Amongst the flurry of commands, there were
a few fundamentals including: sudo, cd, ls, mkdir, apt-get, and other more specialized application commands (ex: npm install PACKAGE).
Once I became familiar with the syntax of these commands, I began to involuntarily memorize them, and could quickly input commands
for the computer to execute (for more detail of what I completed using these commands, please see the Repos and Git Hub page).
After a week or two of consistent usage of ubuntu, I began to realize the tangible differences; although, they were not all benefits.
For instance, in terms of speed and performance, linux is a lot more efficient at booting up and offering a more swift and smooth
experience overall. However, compatibility was an issue with linux, as not many of the applications that I required were available
to download. Overall, my experiences with linux have been quite interesting, it was undoubtedly a valuable learning experience.
