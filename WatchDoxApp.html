    <b>Introduction:</b>
    <br>
    WatchDox, which was recently acquired by BlackBerry, is far superior to its other file sharing
counterparts from larger companies such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box. This is from the highly
advanced level of security that it offers, which boasts a multitude of state of the art technologies.
For instance: there are personalized water marks on the documents which prevent unauthorized sharing,
the ability to revoke access even when the file is offline, and encryption with some of the strongest
and most reputable algorithms, including AES-256 bit. With every passing day, there are more and more
data breaches which can cripple even the largest of big name companies, including Apple and Sony. After
the Sony hack in 2014, a vast majority of their employees' personal information was leaked onto the internet.
However, there were a small percentage of files which remained in safe keeping, the ones that were protected
by WatchDox's proprietary security methods.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Role:</b>
    <br>
    Although I did not have the chance to work with WatchDox's security algorithms, I did have a chance
to test some of the earliest versions of the WatchDox application on the BlackBerry 10 operating system.
Overall, the experience has been invaluable to me as an engineer, because I have never gotten the opportunity
to experience the refined and timely process for updating applications and preparing them for release. More
specifically, I conducted quite scripted testing for this app, because it was in its earliest stages at the
time of conducting the testing. The type of testing I focued on, scripted testing, is quite straightforward
and simple; it is exactly the type of testing which one may presume to take place to find potential bugs or defects.
It consists of explicit testing to see if specific functionalities behave as expected. Compared to exploratory testing
(see Docs To Go App), it does not involve as much thought, but can be more efficient at pinpointing errors
which may impede the performance of the app.
