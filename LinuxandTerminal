    Linux has always seemed to be a daunting and unforgiving operating system, which would be difficult to learn,
and almost impossible to master. This is due to the relentless nature of its command line, which is character
sensative and will not register any commands if they are anything shy of perfect. However, I have had some
previous experience with linux (setting up a NFS file server), learning the syntax of basic commands as well as
experience with installing applications or packages all inside the terminal window. Even though Windows is the far
more popular and widespread operating system that is used by more people, through my perilous journey of learning
linux has led me to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each of the operating systems, and how they were all
developed for different tasks (specialized).
