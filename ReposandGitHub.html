    <b>Introduction:</b>
    <br>
    As many programmers know, managing code can be quite the endeavor. This is especially
true once they have amassed a few projects worth of code over an extended period. However, there
are solutions which can make their lives monumentally easier. One of these solutions is using
Git Hub, a well known website in which one can make an account and easily store files and folders
full of code, making it easier to collaborate with others. Another enhancement in the process sharing
of code is a repository, or repo. Repos make it easier to grant others permissions, commit changes,
or allow them to download copies of the projects for testing. As long as the right permissions and
other conditions are set, repos are a great solution for anyone who wants to share their project
easily, and allow others to collaborate with them and add to the project.

    <br>
    <b>My Role:</b>
    <br>
    Throughout my time at BlackBerry, I have encountered repos on only one occasion, because I was focused
in the quality assurance field. One of my mentors guided me through the process of learning about repos
and how to utilize them. I gained experience through the project that he was working on, which involved
test cases for software. Test cases are simple cause and effect statements which have a trigger then a
follow up action (ex. send an email when a condition is met). Furthermore, I learned how to commit changes
in the repo, checkout into different branches (for permissions and also changing workspaces), and download
a copy of the project for my own experimentation of the test cases. Also, I worked with multiple different
front and back end programs, which comprised the user interface and the server side functionaltiies.
These programs were primarily extensions of Npm (a large program that allows for Javascript developers
to share and reuse code), including Grunt, Nodejs, and Elsa.
