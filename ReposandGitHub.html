    <b>Introduction:</b>

    As many programmers know, managing code can be quite the endeavor. This is especially
true once they have amassed a few projects worth of code over an extended period. However, there
are solutions which can make their lives monumentally easier. One of these solutions is using
Git Hub, a well known website in which one can make an account and easily store files and folders
full of code, which not only is convienient, but more importantly, makes collaborating with others
easier. Another idea which can be beneficial in the sharing of code is a repository, or repo.
Repos make it easier to grant them permissions, commit changes, or allow them to download copies
of the projects for manipulation. As long as the right permissions are set, repos are a great
solution for anyone who wants to share their project easily, and allow others to make changes.


    <b>My Role:</b>

    Throughout my time at BlackBerry, I have encountered repos on one occasion. One of my mentors,
Vishal Chandnani, who worked in the Redwood City office in CA, guided me through the process of
learning about repos and how to utilize them. I gained experience with repos through the project
that Vishal was working on, which involved test cases for software. Test cases are simple cause
and effect statements which have a trigger then another follow up action (which could send an
email for instance). Furthermore, I learned how to commit changes in the repo, checkout into
different branches (for permissions and also changing workspaces), and download a copy of the
project for my own experimentation. Also, I have gained experience with multiple different front
end and back end programs, which comprised the user interface. These programs were primarily
extensions of Npm (a large program that allows for Javascript developers to share and reuse
code), including Grunt, Nodejs, and Elsa.
