    <b>My Role:</b>

    <br>

    Working with the Docs To Go Team and participating in their two week work periods (called sprints) have been a
valuable and rewarding learning experience. About a year ago, the methodology for the development of software
turned completely on its head. Instead of using older, outdated techniques such as Waterfall, engineers and their
managers resorted to a newer, more efficient way of working. It was in this thinking that Agile and Scrum emerged, ready to
be deployed on a large scale. The main difference between the new and the old is largely related to time management.
Firstly, waterfall was a fairly straightforward methodology in which one process came after another (requirements,
design, implementation, etc.). However, Agile/Scrum differs completely in that the entire process is broken into sprints,
which consist solely of development (coding) and testing. The benefits are simple: less time and resources are required,
and the schedule becomes more flexible, allowing for the developers to have a better understanding of their objectives
(which can change frequently). In addition, working in a group environment has been an eye-opening experience for me.
Being a high school student, I have rarely worked with others in groups, especially when it came to labs and projects in
technology classes such as AP Computer Science A. Experiencing and taking a part of a multi-national group has been very
insightful for me to obtain a deeper understanding of the outside working world. Working under strict deadlines and
collaborating with other people enchanced my communication skills, allowed me to extend my own boundaries, and venture
outside my comfort zone-a experience inreplicable in a high school setting.
