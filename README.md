Hello! This is the repository which holds all of the code for Sam Hsieh's website.

This website was completed as a side project during my two month long internship at BlackBerry during the summer of 2015.
The main purpose was for me to learn the skills necessary to make a website, which involves learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Don't know where to start? Begin at the index.html file, as it acts as the homepage.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me at my personal email:

Thank you for visiting! 
-Sam Hsieh
